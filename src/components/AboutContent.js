        <strong>ABOUT BRANDZONE</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Being the premier education fair organizer in the Philippines is a feat that does not happen
        overnight. Brandzone started in 2012 with the desire to help international education
        agencies recruit qualified students through various programs and events.
        <br />
        <br />
        From a humble aspiration headquartered in the heart of the country’s business district,
        Brandzone’s reach has gradually but surely grown to encompass key cities in the Philippines
        – from the bustling cosmopolitan of Metro Manila to the mainland of Cebu, the urbanity of
        Davao – and in time, the rest of the world. <br />
        <br />
        This combination of stable growth and eye for futuristic ideals is our tried and tested
        equation for success, which we guarantee to each of our clients, nothing less, ever more.

      <p>INTERNATIONAL STUDENT RECRUITMENT SOLUTIONS</p>
      <p>Connecting promising students with the best universities, colleges and institutions</p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Our education fairs bank on a holistic approach, thus providing a vantage point to connect
        eligible students with top universities, colleges and institutions in major cities across
        the globe.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The logistics that control the intricate operation of our events is grounded on a principle
        of meticulous planning that takes every detail, miniscule or otherwise, into consideration.
        We take the observations and comments in the surveys of our clientele and participants
        seriously as well as provide them with facilities and collaterals that meet the needs of
        their respective fairs.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The venues of our education fairs are not shots in the dark; rather, they are the beacon of
        accessibility and feasibility. Be it in a hotel function room or mall activity center, our
        venues are well chosen and crafted sites that are conducive to seminars, consultations, and
        presentations for our clients and guests alike. We are committed to locating strong spots in
        Manila, Cebu and Davao – 3 major cities in the Philippines, spread across the main islands
        of the archipelago – to maximize the chances of potential students nationwide.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, the continued growth of our connections has remained palpable. We welcome
        anywhere from 20 to 40 institutions from Australia, New Zealand and Canada for every
        education fair held. Together with this number is our partnership with several more local
        and international education agents.
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        On the same topic of growth, our post-event statistics allude to the attendees generally
        doubling in number, with a 40% attendance rate from [INSERT ??? number of] online
        registrants, which is tantamount to almost 3,500 students in recent years. [NOTE: statistics
        subject to further clarification.]
        <br />
        <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no denying that behind every event, a major contributing factor to its success is
        the efficacy of the marketing strategy we employ. In this quest, we leave no stone unturned
        and make sure that all channels are utilized for seamless promotion. We tap digital
        publicity through sponsored advertisements on social media, company website, search engine
        platforms, and e-mail and e-newsletter invitations. By the same token, we inculcate SMS and
        broadcast or radio promotions, and bring into bargain print advertisements in national and
        local newspapers. We take this a notch higher by incorporating on-ground promotion by means
        of leafleting and distribution of flyers to schools and universities, travel agencies,
        education agents, hospitals, and much more.
        <br />
        <br />

      <p>
        Collating these focal points together, our student recruitment events give rise to a
        triumvirate of good ambience, great service, and excellent company.
